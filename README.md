# web-scraping-challenge

### Background
In this Monash University Data Analytics/Trilogy Education Services homework assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

### Contents
#### This directory contains directory called ***Mission_to_Mars*** which contains the following files and documents:
1. A Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping code used for this assignment called ***mission_to_mars.ipynb***.
2. A Flask app called ***app.py*** for rendering the ***index.html*** file in the ***template*** folder.
3. A seperate ***scrape.py*** file containing the web scraping function used in the app.
4. A folder called ***final application screenshots*** containing screenshots of the rendered application before and after webscraping.
